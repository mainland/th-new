A demo of staged computation with typed Template Haskell as per
[Type-Safe Runtime Code Generation with (Typed) Template Haskell]
(http://gmainland.blogspot.com/2013/05/type-safe-runtime-code-generation-with.html).

The code in this repository is known to work with GHC 7.10.3 and 8.0.1. The only
extra dependency is the  [`ghc-paths` package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-paths).
